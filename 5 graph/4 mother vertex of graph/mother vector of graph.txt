first understand the problem.

Approch is very simple.
	A vertex in graph is mother vector if its comes last in dfs stack.
	means stacking of dfs end on that vector 

Algorithm :

Do DFS traversal of the given graph. While doing traversal keep track of last finished vertex ‘v’. This step takes O(V+E) time.
If there exist mother vertex (or vetices), then v must be one (or one of them). Check if v is a mother vertex by doing DFS/BFS from v. This step also takes O(V+E) time.
