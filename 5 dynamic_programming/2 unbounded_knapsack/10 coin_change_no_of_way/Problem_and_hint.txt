Problem is very nice.
Lets understand it first
	we have given some coin in infinity supply and we have to make the given sum.But we have give number of ways to get that.
	example 
		coin ={ 1,2,3}
		target sum= 5;
		output =5
		explanation number of ways== 2+3,1+1+3,2+2+1,1+1+1+2,1+1+1+1+1 all have sum=5 so number of ways is 5(count of all)
		This is the problem 
		lets comes to the solution 
		the Problem say it infinity supply of coin means that it cannot be knapsack problem.
		and each of coin have choice has select it or not.So its definety unbouded knapsack Problem.
		
		lets understand the corner cases if arr is empty and sum is 0 whether is possible??
			yes possible {} empty set
		similarty sum is 1 and coin is [] then no possible 
		sum 2,3....all are 0
		Now coin size is 1 and sum=0  posssible empty
		   coin size is 2 and sum=0 possible
		  so coin 3,4,5 and sum=0 all possible
		  
		  This problem is very simlar to count_number_of subset
		  
		  solution is also same.
