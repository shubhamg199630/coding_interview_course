This problem is standared 0-1 knapsack problem.
	you have given a weight array and the value array>Its mean that 
	we have n object and each of them is having some weight and and value associcated with them 
	Now what happen that the capacity of your bag is only m.So you can fit only maximum weight.
	example is that
	input weight {10,20,30,40,50}
		value {30.20,40,50,60};
		now m is 100
		output =140
		
		
	Solution is very simple
		we know the recursive solution that we have to choose to pick one element and not to pick same element .
