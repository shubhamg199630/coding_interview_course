Problem
question is you have to divide the given sum into 2 subset set such that diff is equal to diff a given number
example {1,1,2,3} and diff=1;
	sets are= {1,2} and {1,3}
	sets are={1,2} and {1,3};
	sets are {1,1,2} and {3}
	all the set have diff =1;

solution 
read min_diff_subset first then come here
solution is very easy after you read that problem
Note the range is sum of array;
we know s1+s2=range;
and s1-s2=diff;
so adding two 2s1=range+diff
s1=(range+diff)/2;
	that is we have to count number of subset of (range+diff)/2
	thats solve;
