This Problem is very nice.
Note that memorization technique is not wokring here for solution because we required min diff and no perfect target is given here.
Lets understand the question first before comeing to solution.

Here given
	input arr[1,3,7} 
	output 3
	Question we have to divide the given set into 2 set whose diff is minimum.
	in example {1,3} has sum =4 and {7} has sum =7
		diff= 7-4 =3	(solution)
		
	so I think you got the question . We have to divide the given set so that their diff is minimum as possible.
	
	Solution approach -
	
	We have to find two set of minimum difference thats good But its look difficult try to think little more.
	This problem is easy and you will get easily.
	
	okay look here-
		what can be maximum possible answer???
		worst case answer will be equal to sum of array example {123} .Its answer is 123
		so answer can very from 0 to range of array sum.
		so 0 to range (sum ).
		so we have to divide range into two set of minimum diff. 
		example in example {1,3,7} has range =11;
		so if one is {1}  1 and other is {3,7} with is 10.
		so if s1 and s2 are two divided set than (s1+s2=range)    /Very important point .
		if one set is s1 then other is (range -s1) automatically.
		
		We have to include all element is one of the two set.
		So if you notice the problem of sum of subset the last row has contain in top down approach
		has all element included and check for whether is contain sum of 0,1,2,3,.....range .
		
		So let back to min diff if one set is s1 and other is (range -s1).
		min if (range-s1 -s1)= range-2*s1 (if s1 is lass than (range/2)).
		
		
		So last row will give all possible sum and we have to subtract it from range-(2*that sum).
		that the solution 
		minimum positive will be solution.
