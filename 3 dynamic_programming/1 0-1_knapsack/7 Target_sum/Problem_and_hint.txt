Problem
question is you have to array and you have to get target sum using adding and deleting sum.
example {1,1,2,3} and sum=1;					But think little this problem is similar to previous one
	sets are= {1,-1,-2,3} 					sets are= {1,2} and {1,3}
	sets are={-1,1,-2,3} 					sets are={1,2} and {1,3};
	sets are {1,1,2,-3} 					sets are {1,1,2} and {3}
	all the set have sum =1;				all the set have diff =1;
	
	
Same problem and same solution
solution
read min_diff_subset first then come here
solution is very easy after you read that problem
Note the range is sum of array;
we know s1+s2=range;
and s1-s2=sum;
so adding two 2s1=range+sum
s1=(range+diff)/2;
that is we have to count number of subset of (range+diff)/2
thats solve;
